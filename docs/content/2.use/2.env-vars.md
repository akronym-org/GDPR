### Environment variables

If you want to avoid specifying connection details `--url postgres://user:pwd@localhost:5432/mydb`
every time, you can:

* Set env vars
* Use an .env file

Additionally, you can call GDPR with a prepended env var. Currently it's `DATABASE_URL`.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pwd@localhost:5432/mydb gdpr dump
```
