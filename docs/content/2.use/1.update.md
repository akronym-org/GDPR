## ~~Updating permissions~~

::alert{type="warning"}
**Not yet implemented**

You can also (**not yet**) update permissions.
In order to replace all permissions with an updated permissions set use

```bash
gdpr replace < permissions.yml
```

Commit the permissions yaml to git or test if the permissions are reflected by reality in CI/CD.

If you want to update only specific columns, because you're quickly iterating and in a dev env:

```bash
gdpr patch -f table.column --role '*_role' '{ "read": "ALL", "create": "ALL", "update": "ALL" }'
```

If you don't mind also adding permissions for `delete` and `share` you could also simply run:

```bash
gdpr patch -f table.column --role '*_role' ALL
```

You can match roles with regex. In the above example `"*_role"` matches all roles that have the
suffix `_role`

A short version for granting all access to all roles is `{ "*": { "*": "ALL" } }`

You can also update from a file

```bash
gdpr patch -f table.column < patch.yml
```
