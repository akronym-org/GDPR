title: Read permissions

## Read permissions

Connect to your database and output all permissions as JSON.

```bash
gdpr dump -u postgres://user:pwd@localhost:5432/mydb
```

Dump your permissions to yaml with `-o yaml`. You can save your output by redirecting to a file.

```bash
gdpr dump -o yaml > permissions.yaml
```

You can dump permissions in these formats:

* `-o json` – currently disabled
* `-o yaml` – currently disabled
* `-o dot` – graphviz' dot format
* `-o graphml` – graphml. E.g. for use with [yEd Live](https://www.yworks.com/yed-live/)

### Inspect specific tables & columns

Dump a specific resource like this. Use `--resource` or `-r`.

```bash
gdpr dump -r table_name.field_name
```

::alert{type="info"}
GDPR supports wildcards in `--resource` arguments. You must wrap resources with wildcards in `""` or `''`.
::

Chain multiple `--resource`.

```bash
gdpr dump -r "table_name.field_*" -r "directus_*"
```

### Output format

GDPR deduplicates equal permissions and validations if they belong to multiple roles.

The format used by GDPR looks like this (for table_name.field_name)

```yaml
field_name:
  create:
  - roles:
    - role_name
    - role_name_2
    permissions:
    - _and:
      - field_name:
        _ncontains: dirtyword
      - id:
        - lt: 50
  read:
  - roles:
    - role_name
    permissions:
    - _and:
      - id:
        - lt: 50
  update:
  - roles:
    - role_name
    permissions:
    - _and:
      - id:
        - lt: 50
    validation:
    - _and:
      - field_name:
        _ncontains: dirtyword
  delete:
  share:
```

If you use option `--simple` (TODO: find better option name) you can simply display the CRUD actions as:

```yaml
field_name:
  create: role_name, role_name_2
  read: role_name
  update: role_name
  delete:
  share:
```
