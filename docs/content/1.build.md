# How to build

## Install rust

You'll install ü¶Ä Rust with the üì¶ Cargo package manager.

The easiest way is to install both via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

On unix/mac:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

On windows, download https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64

## Clone repo

Go to the github repo of [GDPR](https://github.com/akronym-org/gdpr) and clone the repo.

Or run in a shell

```bash
git pull https://github.com/akronym-org/GDPR.git
cd GDPR
```

## Start Directus and use GDPR

::alert{type="info"}
You need to have a database with Directus. In case you don't have one handy, üê≥ Docker suffices.
::

To start a postgres container with a running Directus instance.

```bash
docker compose -f database/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

Now, try GDPR.

```bash
cargo run -- dump -t thing -f "con*t,id" -o yaml
```

## Build and use GDPR

If you want to build it and simply use it (don't do that yet), run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be in `target/release/`.
